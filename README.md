# Xteink X4 sample rust

This should eventually turn into a usable firmware for the Xteink X4.

## Build
- Rust & cargo
- riscv32 toolchain https://docs.espressif.com/projects/rust/book/getting-started/toolchain.html
- [espflash](https://github.com/esp-rs/espflash/tree/main/espflash/)

Since I want to keep the original partition layout but still use the espflash utils, there is `run.sh` which builds and runs a firmware image.

Can be ran on desktop with `cargo run --package trusty-desktop`

## Structure
Try to put everything in [Core](/core/), so you can run it on a desktop.
